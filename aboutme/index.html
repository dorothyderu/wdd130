    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Dorothy Deru and I am 19 years old. This is my third in person semester here and I am going to transfer to MO state after this year
        I am from St. Louis, Missouri and I am from a family of 6. 
        I am the youngest of 4 siblings and I grew up with many animals. I am currently majoring in marketing
    and considering minoring in apparel construction. I like to cook, workout, and read. My true passion has anything to do with fashion.
While I am at school, I re-sell clothes online and hope to own a shop one day or design my own clothes.
I am excited to be in this class with you as we learn how to navigate the web!  </p>
